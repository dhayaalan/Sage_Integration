# @freshworks/crayons

[Crayons](https://crayons.freshworks.com/) is a library of UI components that help create an intuitive and uniform user interface for all your apps. This collection of [Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) helps developers build apps that adhere to the UX standards set by the Freshworks Design System.

These components are designed to be used in traditional frontend view libraries/frameworks or on their own through traditional JavaScript in the browser.


## Features

* Tiny, highly optimized components built with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)
* No build or compiling required
* Simply add the static files to any project
* Tree shakable bundle for components
* Lazy-loaded components without configuration
* Style customisation through CSS Variables
* Framework Wrappers for React

## Usage

### HTML

Easiest way to start using Crayons is by adding a script tag to the CDN.
More details [here](https://crayons.freshworks.com/introduction/)
```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@freshworks/crayons/dist/crayons/crayons.esm.js">
</script>
<script
  nomodule
  src="https://unpkg.com/@freshworks/crayons/dist/crayons/crayons.js">
</script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@freshworks/crayons/css/crayons-min.css">
```

Any Crayons component added to the webpage will automatically load. This includes writing the component tag directly in HTML, or using JavaScript such as `document.createElement('fw-button')`.
## Framework Bindings

The `@freshworks/crayons` package can be used in simple HTML, or by vanilla JavaScript without any framework at all. Crayons also provides framework bindings that make it easier to integrate Crayons into a framework such as **React**. (However, at the lowest-level framework bindings are still just using Crayons core and Web Components).

To use **React wrapper** use below:
```js
import { FwButton } from "@freshworks/crayons/react"
```
For more information please check [here](https://crayons.freshworks.com/frameworks/react)

### Naming Components
When generating components, the custom element tags is prefixed with `fw-` while the rest of the name is modified to support web component standards. For example, if a component is generated with the name Label, the component name would be `<fw-label>`.
