/**
 * Checks if a given phone number is valid.
 *
 * If the `number` is a string, it will be parsed to an object,
 * but only if it contains only valid phone number characters (including punctuation).
 * If the `number` is an object, it is used as is.
 *
 * The optional `defaultCountry` argument is the default country.
 * I.e. it does not restrict to just that country,
 * e.g. in those cases where several countries share
 * the same phone numbering rules (NANPA, Britain, etc).
 * For example, even though the number `07624 369230`
 * belongs to the Isle of Man ("IM" country code)
 * calling `isValidNumber('07624369230', 'GB', metadata)`
 * still returns `true` because the country is not restricted to `GB`,
 * it's just that `GB` is the default one for the phone numbering rules.
 * For restricting the country see `isValidNumberForRegion()`
 * though restricting a country might not be a good idea.
 * https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/FAQ.md#when-should-i-use-isvalidnumberforregion
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * ```js
 * isValidNumber('+78005553535', metadata)
 * isValidNumber('8005553535', 'RU', metadata)
 * isValidNumber('88005553535', 'RU', metadata)

// For some reason Google's metadata contains `<intlFormat/>`s with brackets and dashes.
// Meanwhile, there's no single opinion about using punctuation in international phone numbers.
//
// For example, Google's `<intlFormat/>` for USA is `+1 213-373-4253`.
// And here's a quote from WikiPedia's "North American Numbering Plan" page:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan
//
// "The country calling code for all countries participating in the NANP is 1.
// In international format, an NANP number should be listed as +1 301 555 01 00,
// where 301 is an area code (Maryland)."
//
// I personally prefer the international format without any punctuation.
// For example, brackets are remnants of the old age, meaning that the
// phone number part in brackets (so called "area code") can be omitted
// if dialing within the same "area".
// And hyphens were clearly introduced for splitting local numbers into memorizable groups.
// For example, remembering "5553535" is difficult but "555-35-35" is much simpler.
// Imagine a man taking a bus from home to work and seeing an ad with a phone number.
// He has a couple of seconds to memorize that number until it passes by.
// If it were spaces instead of hyphens the man wouldn't necessarily get it,
// but with hyphens instead of spaces the grouping is more explicit.
// I personally think that hyphens introduce visual clutter,
// so I prefer replacing them with spaces in international numbers.
// In the modern age all output is done on displays where spaces are clearly distinguishable
// so hyphens can be safely replaced with spaces without losing any legibility.
